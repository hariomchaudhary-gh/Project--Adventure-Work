    1.SQL to fetch data from the databases.
    
    2.Power query editor to transform the data.
    
    3.Excel & Power BI to analyse the initial patterns and identify the key performance indicators.
    
    4.Power BI dax to make calculated measures/columns.
    
    5.Power BI for visualizing and dashboarding.


INSIGHTS

      1. Canada and European countries are having less sales revenue compared to United States and Australia.
      2. Accessories and clothing categories are having negligible sales revenue despite having a huge share in sales volume.
      3. Profit margin for accessories is highest among all the categories, amounts to aprx 52%.
      4. Accessories are having aprx 60% of share is sales volume and profit margin is also more than 50% which is a good sign.
      5. Most of the customers belong to 40-54 years of age. Elderly people are very less in numbers.
      6. Unmarried customers are lesser than married customers. 
      7. Gender wise customer distribution is 50-50 which shows male and female are equally purchasing the products.
      8. Customers living closer (within 0-1 Miles of distance) to the store are visiting more.


RECOMMENDATIONS

    1. Need to increase the footprints in Europe and Canada.
    2. Elderly friendly bike can be launched to tap the elderly customers segment.
    3. To attract unmarried customers we can organize some events where they can meet new people.
    4. Door step delivery can solve the problem of commutation for customers living far.
    5. New branches can be opened in different areas in the longer run that people don't need to cummute far.

SUMMARY

    This project is about Adventure Works dataset, analyzing which I learnt how to analyze sales data and collect insightful trends and patterns which can lead to the data driven decision making.
    
    I got the hands on practice of tools like Advance Excel, power query editor, pivot table, data modelling, Power BI,  dax, drill down, drill through, SQL etc.
    
    I learnt how to perform data cleaning, treating null values and handling blanks, merging tables, analyzing data, identifying important columns and key performance indicators, visualizing the data and dashboarding.
    
    I would like to further contribute to the data driven industry and unravel the hidden patterns and trends that it can become the growth engine for my company.
